                        the design vision of projects and the management of 
                        the Mason Studio team. An advocate of purposeful design, 
                        Ashley has been a key part of the development of Mason 
                        Studio’s innovative research-based process. She ensures 
                        design decisions are thoughtfully evaluated based on their 
                        potential contribution to the end user, design process, 
                        and client’s goals. Her collaborative approach ensures a

                        of the entire team to fully inform each design project. As a 
                        respected leader in the Canadian design community, Ashley has 
                        also been featured in international design media and regularly

                        Stanley Sun’s vision is informed by a unique blend of formal 
                        studies in human sciences, fine arts and interior design. 
                        Approaching each challenge with a combined scientific and 
                        humanistic perspective, he first observes how people experience 
                        and react to the built environment to create a rational and 
                        intuitive design solution. Of particular interest to Stanley’s 
                        practice is the science of light and the physiological and 
                        psychological response people have to light. As an advocate for 
                        Canadian design, Stanley has been published widely and has participated 
                        as a keynote speaker at leading design conferences. He is also a 
                        sessional instructor at his alma mater, Toronto Metropolitan University.
